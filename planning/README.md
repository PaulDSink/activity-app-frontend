## Description  

My trails app was created with the outdoor enthusiast in mind. It is used to help a user find areas and trails in their area based on what activity they area looking to do.

## Approach  

My approach for this project was to determine what was needed for my minimum viable product(MVP) and create an application that met my MVP requirements. I started planning by first focusing on my MVP outcome and what it would look like to help plan using model diagrams and mapping my database structure, creating wireframes, etc.. Once I created my application to meet my MVP goals, I could then focus on adding post MVP elements.

### MVP

My MVP goals were simple. I wanted to create a functioning backend API that send locations with a list of trails for each location based on what activity the user is looking to do. I also wanted to create a user login functionality that helped determine whether that user could create, delete, or update information in  the database if they had administrator status. Then, I wanted to create a frontend application that could render and perform this functionality.

### Post MVP  

I have a lot of post MVP goals. First, I want to focus heavy on coming up with a very professional looking styling concept and user experience. I am looking to also incorporate the google maps API along with the addresses of the locations stored in my database to render a map on the locations page to help the user find locations close to them rather than viewing a long list of locations.

### Unsolved Problems  

There are many problems and loose ends I plan to correct. First, I want to create a much fuller database with many activities, locations, and trails.
